# Cloud Infrastructure on Azure with Terraform 

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/aussiedevcrew/terraform-azure-sample/_apis/build/status/xtellurian.terraform-azure-sample)](https://dev.azure.com/aussiedevcrew/terraform-azure-sample/_build/latest?definitionId=1)

## What's the point?

Infrastructure as code provides many benefits, but sometimes at the expense of local developers who cannot create infrastructure from their own machines. This is in fact a huge and hidden problem, that can massively lower the productivity of software engineering teams.

This repository is a contribution on the subject of continuous deployment of infrastructure without sacrificing the developer experience. The core goals are:

 * Anyone can create and destroy infrastructure from their local machine.
 * A complete environment can be created from a minimum of configuration inputs.
 * Infrastructure can be continously deployed.
 * Infrastructure as code implies immutable and idempotent deployments.

In this project:

 * Everything is CLI, everything works in bash, everything runs in containers, and every script works locally.
 * [Terraform's HCL](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html) provides declarative infrastructure definitions.
 * Azure Pipelines continuously integrate and deploy infrastructure using custom and containerised [build and release agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=vsts) running as [Azure Container Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/) with [managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-managed-identity).


In this example, we will deploy an Azure Web App with Terraform and Azure Pipelines. 

## Technologies

 * [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): Infrastructure definition and deployments
 * [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/): Continuous Integration and Deployment
 * [Azure Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview) Application host

## Authenticate Azure CLI

> `az login`

## Quickstart

 The makefile in the project root directory can be used to get started locally.   Begin by authenticating to Azure (see below).  Afterwards, update the project name in the Makefile (first line).   From there you can run the following commands to have AKS deployed from your computer.

 ```bash
 make init
 make plan
 make apply
 ```

 You may need to adjust some of the service/app ad accounts, details can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/aad-integration)

 Current issue with az cli [details](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/7283) 

## Get started locally

All terraform commands can be run via bash scripts. Scripts ending in `.local.sh` are intended to be run on a developer's machine. In a CI/CD pipeline, `.local.sh` scripts should not be used.


### Running the shell

> `docker-compose run cli`

In the root directory, run the above for a local shell with terraform, and Azure CLI installed. You can see the Dockerfile for this shell at [`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile)



### Initialising Terraform

> `./src/init.local.sh`

You can edit [`src/init.local.sh`](src/init.local.sh) to suit your environment.

`init.local.sh` is a wrapper around `init.sh`, which initialises terraform with remote state in an Azure Storage account.

### Planning with Terraform

> `./src/plan.local.sh`

This script will use [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html). A `dev.local.tfplan` file will be created, which is referenced in `tfplan.local.sh`

### Create and Destroy Infrastructure with Terraform

> `./src/tfapply.local.sh`

You can edit  [`./src/tfapply.local.sh`](src/tfapply.local.sh) as you like. Any changes made to your terraform configuration will be applied to your Azure subscription, __but not to production!__

### Destroy Infrastructure

> `./src/plan-destroy.local.sh`
>
> `./src/tfapply.local.sh`

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

### Build/Release Agents

We use custom build agents running on Azure Container Instances. These agents have all the default Azure DevOps tools installed, plus terraform. The agents also are created with a Managed Identity that is given contributor access to the subscription. This is how terraform gains access to the Azure Resource Manager.

Firstly, [create a new agent pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?view=vsts#creating-agent-pools) in Azure DevOps called terraform-aci.

Then, [get a Personal Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=vsts#create-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate-access) from Azure DevOps, and copy into into `.secrets/vststoken.secret`

To create an agent, edit and run the following script:

> `./agents/create-agent.sh -t "$(cat .secrets/vststoken.secret)" -g tf-agents -n vs-agent -a <YOUR_AZUREDEVOPS_ACCOUT_NAME>`

Note, this can take several minutes as the image is large.

### Connecting Azure DevOps to Azure

You'll need to [set up a Service Connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=vsts) to Azure. My connection is simply called `rian` but you can call yours something different, and rename it in `azure-pipelines.yml`

### CI

Continuous integration means changes in source code are continuously tested then merged into the main product. This project uses Azure Pipelines [yaml build definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started-yaml?view=vsts). You can see the [build definition](azure-pipelines.yml) in the root of this project. In the build:

 * bash scripts are checked for validity
 * terraform files are checked for correct formatting
 * a terraform plan is generated (but not used)

### CD

We're going to use Azure Pipelines to continously deploy our infrastructure.

Since all our tools are bash scripts, we are just going to run three Azure CLI tasks.

#### Task Configuration

##### Init Azure Terraform Backend

 * Set the Script Path to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_infra/prod-drop/src/init.sh`
 * Set the arguments to `-g $(tfstate.resourcegroup) -a $(tfstate.storageaccountname) -e $(environment)`

##### terraform plan

 * Set the Script Path to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_infra/prod-drop/src/plan.sh`
 * Set the arguments to `-e $(environment) -g $(tfstate.resourcegroup) -a $(tfstate.storageaccountname) -p "$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/terraform.tfplan" -f "$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/tfplan-now.summary.txt"`

##### terraform apply

 * Set the Script Path to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_infra/prod-drop/src/tfapply.sh`
 * Set the arguments to `-p "$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/terraform.tfplan"`

#### Job Configuration

On the agent job, make sure you choose the `terraform-aci` agent pool.

#### Artifacts Configuration

![Azure Devops artifact config screenshot](images/AzureDevOps-artifacts.jpg)

Select the build (it's defined in `azure-pipelines.yml`) as your artifact, and name it `_infra`

### Azure DevOps Build and Release variables

Set the following variables in your release pipeline

 * `tfstate.resourcegroup` : the resource group for your terraform state storage account
 * `tfstate.storageaccountname` : the name of the storage account for your terraform state
 * `environment` : i.e. dev, prod. not necessarily used but useful

## Local Secrets

Most secrets should be pulled from Azure CLI at runtime. For secrets that cannot, create a `.secrets` directory in the root of the project.

 * `vststoken.secret` -> Personal Access Token for Azure DevOps (used by release agent)
